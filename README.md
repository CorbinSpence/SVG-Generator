## Installation

You need to install node ver. 16.0.0 and the latest version of npm. You may also need to run "npm i" in the repo folder to install dependencies.

## Usage

First, you go to your terminal and change your directory to the repo folder. Then you type "node index.js" to run the code. You will be given 4 prompts that ask about the colors, text and shape of the desired svg. The text should be no greater than 3 characters. Color can be specified either by name or by hex code (e.g. #000000). Once everything is properly set up, a svg should appear under "assets" with a name that is generated based on your parameters.
